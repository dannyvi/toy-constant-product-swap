# Toy Constant Product Pool

A toy pool that swaps the currency pair managed with uniswap V2 Protocal.

Simply implemented deposit, withdraw, and swap function.

With aspects to be depth into as follows:

* Raises NotImplementedError if deposit liquidity with unbalanced amount of 
  currencies same as the proportional amount reserved in the pool.
  
* The Fee was simply kepted in the pool and unparticipate with the distribution 
  of liquidity provider shares.
  
* Wondering that whether the algorithm of price and the impact was properly
  implemented.
